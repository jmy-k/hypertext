# hypertextCOLLABORATIVE WEB ART ASSIGNMENT (suggested steps/tips; no need to follow exactly) 
1. Set aside 3 hours when you are both free. You can do this all at once, or in a couple spurts, but you should be together AFK for a total of 3 hours.
2. Before meeting, each person should choose 5-15 elements you might like to incorporate: stuff you’re excited or curious about right now. Those 5-15 elements may include: themes, videos, images, texts, a specific mode of interaction, etc. Videos/images/texts can be original (ie., you made them) or found (ie., you’re quoting or referencing someone else). 
NOTE: We may do this portion in class!
3. Get together and build a work of web art! Probably one person will be the main typist/coder.
4. There are no “requirements” for this web artwork; just be sure to spend at least 3 solid hours on it. 
    a. Try to make something you’re proud of and excited to share with the class. 
    b. This assignment should not be a source of stress; have fun and enjoy your collaboration!
5. If the creativity is flowing, don’t hesitate to spend way more than 3 hours!
