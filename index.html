        As it accelerates, it
        deteriorates. It is a ghost of an image, a preview, a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed
        for free, squeezed through slow digital connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied
        and pasted into other channels of distribution.</div>
